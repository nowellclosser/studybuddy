A system for scheduling studying and review of technical books backed by Trello.


TODO/NOTES:
- Cards should really be a separate table from book sections
- Formalize/document host setup: python3.8 (+ special sqlite stuff), ssh key, git, TRELLO_TOKEN
- TRELLO TOKEN goes in /etc/environment
- logrotate on server
- set last reviewed date for review cards
